# Mushroom-Dataset-Exploration-and-Naive-Bayes-Modeling

This project focuses on the exploration and modeling of the Mushroom dataset. The tasks include visualizing the number of mushrooms for each cap category to observe the distribution. Pairwise relationships in the dataset are plotted for each stalk category to analyze potential correlations. The distribution of mushrooms is visualized based on stalk category, habitat, and population. A Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier is built to predict mushroom classes, and its accuracy is evaluated. Furthermore, a model is built using Bernoulli Naive Bayes after hyperparameter tuning, and the ROC score is calculated to assess its performance. The project aims to explore the dataset and build accurate classification models for mushroom classification.
